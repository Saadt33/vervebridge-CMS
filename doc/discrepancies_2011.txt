DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CMS AND IOI 2011 OFFICIAL RULES
=====================================================

This document details the differences between the current capabilities
of CMS and the official IOI 2011 rules, i.e., the features that need
to be added to CMS to fully comply with the rules used in 2011.

Warning: I'm working with rules detailed here[1], which appear to be
draft. I don't know where to find a more up-to-date copy.

 * Attachments: the contestants must be able to download skeleton
   implementations and other files related to some task from the Web
   interface; in CMS database there is a table 'attachments' for this
   sort of files, but the Web interface doesn't show anything.

 * Communication tasks: not implemented.

 * RunC interface, both command-line and gedit plugin versions: not
   implemented.

 * Translation support: currently the website is (could be) localized,
   but tasks statements are composed of a single binary file. We
   should change the statement information to a map language -> binary
   file. Moreover, users should be able to choose their language (for
   interface and statements).

 * Clarification requests: the rules do not prohibite an electronic
   form for sending and answering questions. The system handles this,
   but does not handle translations (it stores only the "localized"
   copies of the questions and answers). Problem: the managers should
   be able to input the localized answer (which could also be in a
   non-latin alphabet). Though, most of the time the answer is
   standard, so there is no need to translate it.

 * Cheating logging: the rules consider cheating also "probing the
   server with customized URL"; probably we could create a "cheat log"
   where we log events like this.

 * Nearly all the Competition Server is ill-worded, and interpreting
   it strictly would make most of CMS not according to the rules
   (e.g., it implicitly assumes that there is only one Competition
   Server and that it runs on the same hardware as the contestants'
   computer, while the only logical requirements is that the workers
   run in the same environment as contestants).

 * Printing interface: not implemented.

 * Test interface: not implemented (and probably we also need some
   modification to the database to support it).

 * Audible end signals: probably the system must offer some interface
   to trigger the audible signals that mark the end of the
   competition.

 * Re-evaluation: according to the rules, contestants are notified
   when some of their submissions if re-evaluated; this must be done
   manually by the managers (that initiated the re-evaluation).
