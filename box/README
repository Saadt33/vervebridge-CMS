This directory is just a convenience mirror of directory "box" from
repository:

git://gitorious.org/giomasce-moe/giomasce-moe.git

That repository is itself a copy of:

git://git.ucw.cz/eval.git

with some slight modifications to better suit our needs.

NO ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE MADE HERE! Modification done here
should just be synchronization from the above repositories, where real
development happen. Please, don't do any exception to this rule, as
they're very difficult to track.


=== How to compile the mo-box ===

Use the script compile{32,64}.sh, according to your architecture. Then
copy the "mo-box" executable in the main directory of the cms (the
"system" directory in this repository).
